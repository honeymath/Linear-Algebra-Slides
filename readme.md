These slides have been used for my Linear Algebra courses since 2018, when I began teaching at the University of Toronto and POSTECH since 2023.

All slides can be previewed in the `preview` folder. File names indicate the corresponding topics.

To edit a slide, modify the `.tex` file with the same name and recompile `main.tex` using `pdflatex`.

Ensure that the relevant slide is included in `main.tex` via `\input{file_name}` (uncommented).

Important: `main.tex` must include `\input{packaga}` at the beginning, which loads all required packages.
The spelling of "packaga" is intentional.

The repository was uploaded in 2025 to support others studying or teaching the subject.

The slides are written in LaTeX. You may clone the repository, uncomment the desired topics in `main.tex`, and compile them using pdflatex. All source files are included in this repository.
